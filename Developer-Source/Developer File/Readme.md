# How to report bug?
It may happen that during the execution of beta or stable versions you may encounter some problems. To improve more and more Cat-Net we advise you to report it to the central development team.
# How?
To report glitches or software bugs you could write an email to this email address support@aronky.com with these information:
- Short description of the bug / glitch you want to report
- System configuration (Provide as much data as you can, we may have to ask you for additional data)
- Steps to reproduce the error (Please be as accurate as possible)
- (Optional) Lines concerned with the problem (or if it is a problem outside the code but inherent with Cat-Net insert photos / files etc that represent the problem)
- (Optional) Solution of the problem, if you want you can also do a pull in the main gith repository

We hope this mini guide was helpful to you, love from Aronky.
