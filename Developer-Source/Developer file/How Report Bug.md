# How report bug?
It may happen that during the execution of beta or stable versions you may encounter some problems. obviously to improve more and more cat-net we advise you to report it to the central development team.
# How?
To report glitches or software bugs you could write an email to this email address (support@aronky.com) with these information:
- Short description of the bug / glitch you want to report
- Lines concerned with the problem (or if it is a problem outside the code but inherent with cat-net insert photos / files etc that represent the problem)
- (Optional) solution of the problem, if you want you can also do a pull in the main gith repository

We hope this mini guide was helpful to you, love from aronky team.
