# Welcome Developer!
This readme is dedicated to you! Here you will find all the rules / guides to develop Cat-Net!
Obviously please respect the rules and the Cat-Net [license](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies/Cat-Net/blob/main/LICENCE). Having said that, let's see these rules!
## How to develop Cat-Net?
Cat-Net as an open-source project, you can read-modify the code to your liking, but you can't do what you want with the distribution. Cat-Net developers can be divided into multiple groups:

⚠️ Obviously, as the code license states, for each modified version of Cat-Net it is ***mandatory*** to mention the developers and the main repository.

- **Personal Developers**:
Personal developers are those developers who read or modify for personal / educational reasons, but who will never aim to distribute their modified version. Of course we allow any kind of modification, but even if this version of Cat-Net is personal, please mention both the [main repository](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies/Cat-Net) and the developers!
- **External Developers**: 
External developers are the type of developers who write (starting from the Cat-Net source code) their own version, with additional features, bug fixes etc. To start developing a new version of Cat-Net it is mandatory to fork ours main repository (obviously by modifying the fork code). Of course, we ask you to kindly make pull requests with portions of the new code! instead to distribute the code go further down in the readme, you will find all the information you are looking for!
- **Internal developers**:
The internal developers are the people who are part of the Aronky Technologies organization. They will develop for the official versions of Cat-Net, such as [@IsTk0](github.com/IsTk0) (The founder of the Cat-Net project) and [@AronkyDev](github.com/AronkyDev) (Developer of Cat-Net for the Win32-64 version). To become an in-house Cat-Net developer, you must first write an application to this email [info@aronky.com](mailto:info@aronky.com). Obviously in the "Developer File" folder you will find the application presets to send us. After joining our development team, everything will be explained to you in detail!

## How to report bug?
To report bugs look at the readme in the "Developer file" folder.

## Conclusions:
For any type of problem, contact these two email addresses: [support@aronky.com](mailto:support@aronky.com) and [info@aronky.com](mailto:info@aronky.com). We hope you have a great time working for Cat-Net! Thanks for everything developers. Love from Aronky!
