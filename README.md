# Cat-Net
## Presentation üíª:
What is Cat-Net? Cat-Net is a program that meets all those situations or problems that developers encounter. Why do you need more programs to do two or three things when there is Cat-Net? Cat-Net is a "Swiss Army Knife" in the handle of you developers! With him you can perform very simple operations such as server pings to encrypted ssh connections!
## How to run Cat-Net üóÉ:
Cat-Net as an opensource software we have thought of multiple types of possible installations / executions.
However, as for any type of software, requirements must be respected. Including: having any version of Python (which is compatible with libraries), and all libraries (pay attention to the fact that Cat-Net version for windows requires more libraries than other versions!). If you have problems with various installations you can consult the lower points, create an issue or contact us in this email: [support@aronky.com](mailto:support@aronky.com). Having said that, let's begin to see how to install Cat-Net.
## Installation üíΩ:
- **First method:**
Automatic installation:
To install libraries, dependencies and cat-net, just go to Releases -> go to the latest release (we recommend the stable version) -> choose the installer compatible with your operating system -> and run it in your terminal (it will ask you your password). Once this is done it will find you all the installed libraries and Cat-Net executable. If you have difficulty running Cat-Net use the launcher (always compatible with the version of your system). If while running Cat-Net should give some problems caused by the lack of libraries, just write in your terminal:
```bash
pip install "pack name"
```
- **Second method**
Manual Installation:
This last type of installation is reserved for those who want to produce (paying attention to the [license](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies/Cat-Net/blob/main/LICENCE)) a modified version of Cat-Net, for those who want to add changes to the initial code (for personal use and not) or for those who want to test / debug the code. To download Cat-Net just download the entire repository by clicking [here](https://github.com/AronkyTechnologies/Cat-Net/releases) (obviously choosing the latest version or beta or stable). by doing so you will have all the resources to develop your Cat-Net version. To get the internal Cat-Net development files you can use the codes located in the "Developer-Source" folder. While if you want to become an official Cat-Net developer you need to write an email to this email address [info@aronky.com](mailto:info@aronky.com). For more information see the readme called "Developer-rm".

## NEWS:‚ùóÔ∏è
Currently the Cat-Net developers are working on the creation of Cat-Net executables without the need for installation (.exe for Windows and .exec / .app for Mac unfortunately the Linux version is still delayed. But soon it will be implemented too! ). Currently they are developing in addition to the executables also the version with graphical interface of cat-net which will be released through version 2.5.0 (in BETA version) together with new features and bug fixes!

## Conclusions:
For any problem related to the code please contact us immediately so we can resolve it. Thank you very much "smanettone". Love from Aronky! 
 
 **Cat-Net Lv = 2.1.0 (STABLE) and LvB = 2.1.1 (BETA) and FvD = 2.5.0 (BETA)**
